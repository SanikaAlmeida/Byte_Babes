The program has sent several robotic missions to Mars, including rovers, landers, and orbiters.\n\nOne of the most notable missions is the Curiosity Rover, which has been exploring Mars since 2012. Curiosity is a car-sized rover that is equipped with a range of scientific instruments, including cameras, spectrometers, and geology tools. It has been studying the Martian surface and subsurface, and has discovered evidence of ancient lakes, rivers, and even an ocean on Mars.\n\nAnother notable mission is the Perseverance Rover, which launched in 2020 and landed on Mars in February 2021. Perseverance is also a car-sized rover, but it is equipped with a suite of instruments specifically designed to search for signs of past or present life on Mars. It has been studying the Martian surface and has discovered evidence of ancient lakes and rivers, as well as potential habitats for life.\n\nNASA is also planning to send a new rover to Mars in 2022, called the Mars 2022 Orbiter. This orbiter will study the Martian atmosphere and provide communication relay services for future Mars missions.\n\nPrivate companies like SpaceX and Blue Origin are also working on Mars missions, with SpaceX aiming to send its first crewed mission to Mars as early as the mid-2020s and Blue Origin planning to send its first human mission to Mars in the 2020s.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the many Mars missions that have been planned and executed over the years.

This includes the cost of designing and building the rover, launching it into space, and operating it on Mars.\n\nThe Perseverance Rover mission has a budget of around $2.4 billion, although this number may change as the mission continues.\n\nIt's worth noting that these costs are just a small part of NASA's overall budget for planetary science and exploration. NASA's budget for fiscal year 2020 was around $20 billion, with a portion of that going towards planetary science and exploration.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the estimated costs for some of the major Mars missions:\n\n* Curiosity Rover: $2.5 billion\n* Perseverance Rover: $2.4 billion\n* Mars 2020 Orbiter: $250 million\n* Mars 2022 Orbiter: $200 million\n* Mars Sample Return: $1 billion (estimated)\n\nKeep in mind that these costs are subject to change and may not reflect the actual costs of the missions, which can be affected by a variety of factors, including changes in mission requirements, technological challenges, and budget constraints."}, {"type": "human", "content": "when is the next launch planned?"}, {"type": "ai", "content": "NASA has several Mars missions planned for the near future.
